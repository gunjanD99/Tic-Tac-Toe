<h1>Tic-tac_toe</h1>
In my recent project, I created a Tic Tac Toe website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, applying these technologies to build an interactive and visually appealing game.

HTML5 was fundamental in structuring the web page, ensuring that the game layout was both semantic and accessible. 
I used various HTML5 elements to create the board, buttons, and other interactive elements. 
The use of <div>tags allowed me to structure the game grid, which consisted of nine clickable cells, each representing a position on the Tic Tac Toe board. 
Additionally, I incorporated many tags and elements.

CSS3 was instrumental in designing the user interface and enhancing the overall user experience. 
I utilized CSS Grid to create a flexible, responsive grid system for the game board, ensuring that it looked consistent across different screen sizes. 
I also applied CSS3 styles to customize the appearance of the game, such as using background colors, borders, and 
hover effects to make the cells visually distinctive when interacted with. CSS3 animations were used to add subtle transitions 
when players placed their X or O marks, adding a layer of interactivity and polish to the game.

JavaScript was the driving force behind the gameâ€™s functionality. 
I used JavaScript to manage the game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and resetting the game. 
Event listeners were attached to each cell, allowing players to click on a cell to place their mark, which triggered the JavaScript functions to check for a win or a draw. 
JavaScript also updated the UI in real-time, providing instant feedback to players. Additionally, 
I implemented a feature that allows players to restart the game without refreshing the page, enhancing the user experience.

Overall, the combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript allowed me to create a fully functional, interactive Tic Tac Toe game that is both engaging and user-friendly.
